# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

# Submission Instructions

## _Overview_
My goal towards the application is to the apply the knowledge that I already have for the bulk of the project while gaining a few skills to enhance the UI/UX. 

The overview of my project will be a similar LMS (Learning Management System) to "Google Classroom". The objective is to create a platform for the user to create/update/delete posts. Alternatively, I would love to to create a hierarchy of user logins where the Admin is the only user allowed to create/update/delete posts, and regular users (students) are only allowed to read and comment on the post(s).
## _Features_
The features for my application will include:  
   
   1. **Login Authentication**: Users can Login in as Admin or Student.  
   2. **Create Posts**: User (Admin) can create a post for the class to see.  
   3. **Update Posts**: User (Admin) can update the contents of the post.  
   4. **Delete Posts**: User (Admin) can delete the post.  
   5. **Comment on posts**: User (Student) can create a comment under the post.
## _Technologies_
My technology Stack (for now) will revolve around the .Net Framework:  
  
  1. Asp.Net  
  2. C#  
  3. Bootstrap
  4. HTML5  
  5. CSS3  
  6. MySQL (or SQL Server)
## _What I'll Have to Learn_
For me to be successful in creating an application, I will need to keep things simple enough to where it will allow me to focus on the UI/UX. I have been wanting to learn how to use SQL Server alongside the .Net Framework stack, but I have enough understanding with My SQL that if I am pressed for time it might be best to stick to what I know.  

I also want to dedicate some time to refine my frontend skills. To be honest, I would like this this app to look good with limited functionality, rather than be technical but look unpleasing. When an employer looks at my project, I want them to see a refined and polished app.  

Lastly, if I have the time, I would like to add a comment-section feature to the posts where the user (students) will be able to create a comment, update, and delete it.
